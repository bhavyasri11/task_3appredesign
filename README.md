**DOMAIN**: UI/UX

**DURIATION**: 4 WEEKS

**MENTOR**: NEELA SANTOSH

**DISCRIPTION OF THE TASK WHAT I HAVE DONE**:

Users faced visual clutter due to unorganized and excessive promotional banners.

Navigation across services like delivery and dine-out lacked clarity.

Restaurant discovery was time-consuming and not well categorized.

Safety features and trust indicators were not prominently displayed.

The interface felt heavy and overwhelming, making the user journey less intuitive.
